# BinarySearchTree

This is a AVL Tree I created as a part of my Data Structures course. 


It contains the following functions:


1) insertion

2) deletion

3) searching

4) traversal (inorder, preorder and postorder)


I have uploaded a driver class, so that you can see how to use functions of the Binary Search Tree



# Theory

An AVL Tree is a balanced binary tree, where the height largest path in a subtree is almost the same, has a difference of either 0 or 1.
This tree is important as it reduces the time complexity for searching an element stored in the tree.
